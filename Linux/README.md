## Linux Bash Scripts

Here are some simple bash scripts for isolating data and events from logs. Here we have the scenario of an investigation for a casino losing unusual amounts of money, that casino dealers and players may be colluding to steal money by cheating from within three possible casino games, in particular specific illegitimate losses have been identified at a Roulette table. The scripts included correlate the unusual loss events/times, with the roulette dealers and players at those particular times. The scripts analyse existing log events; as well thereâ€™s a script that can be used for analysis of future events. These scripts essentially focus on grep and awk commands that correlate with the log data layout.

The following script will manually pull the Roulette loss event dealer's name that was working at 05:00:00 AM on the 3rd of March, and appending the output to the investigation file "Dealers_Working_During_Losses". Each entry will be labelled with the date. The date can be adjusted by changing the date being labelled and changing log file date being accessed. The time can also be adjusted in the script. Alternatively, a collection of scripts of times and calendar days can be made to access this type of data.

```
#!/bin/bash/
#
#Just assign time and date
#
echo "Date: 0310" >> Dealers_Working_During_Losses
cd ~/Casino_Theft_Investigations/Roulette_Loss_Investigation/Dealer_Analysis
grep "05:00:00 AM" 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5, $6}' >> Dealers_Working_During_Losses
```

The following script will be able to pull any day and time as explained in the script. Regardless of the filename, providing they are logged systematically starting with day/month or vice versa, the user need on input into the command line: day/month (0310), time (05:00:00), AM or PM (AM), and the output will provide the time and name of the dealer. Multiple days could be searched at once in this way (eg. 03* would search all of May), although these entries won't as yet identify the days. 

```
#!/bin/bash
# cat $1* for the date for example 0310 for March 10, $2 for the time eg. 05:00:00, $3 for AM or PM
# grep will isolate the correct line from the log data
# awk will print the field data - time and name. eg. 05:00:00 AM Billy Jones 
cat $1* | grep $2 | grep $3 |  awk -F" " '{print $1, print $2, print $5, print$6}'
```
