There were 13 major loss event periods in the Roulette section between March 10 and March 15.
Five were on 0310, five were on 0312 and three were on 0315.
Billy Jones was the main Roulette Dealer during each of these.
Though there were a variety of players during every loss period, Mylie Schmidt was playing Roulette during every one of the 13 loss periods.
No other player had played during more than one of the loss periods.

There is a very clear correlation between this dealer and this player.
It is our belief that they are in collusion and further investigation is required.
